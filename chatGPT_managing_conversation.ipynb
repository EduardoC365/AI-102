      "### Step 1: Set Up Your Azure Account\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create an Azure Account**: \n",
      "   - Go to the Azure website (https://azure.microsoft.com) and sign up for an account. If you already have an account, log in.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Subscription**: \n",
      "   - You might need an appropriate Azure subscription that includes access to the OpenAI service.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Create an OpenAI Resource\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Navigate to Azure Portal**: \n",
      "   - Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create a Resource**:\n",
      "   - Click on “Create a resource” from the top left corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Search for OpenAI**:\n",
      "   - In the search bar, type \"OpenAI\" and select \"OpenAI Service\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fill in the Details**:\n",
      "   - Provide the required information such as the resource name, subscription, resource group, and location. \n",
      "   - You may also need to select the pricing tier based on your usage needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Review and Create**:\n",
      "   - After filling in the details, review your settings and click on \"Create\" to provision the resource.\n",

      "### Step 3: Get API Keys\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Get Your API Key**:\n",

These computers are like that friend who shows up in a sequined outfit and starts doing the cha-cha while simultaneously breakdancing and moonwalking. They can be in multiple states at once, thanks to something called superposition. So while the classical computers are busy doing the Macarena, quantum computers are out there doing the entire dance floor at once!\n",
