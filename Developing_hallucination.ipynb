    "\n",
    "When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate\n",
    "- It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
    "- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
    "2. Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
    "- It is important to keep relevant terms such as knowledge base articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
    "- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
    "3. Start with the most advanced model\n",
    "- There is a cost vs quality trade-off when using the most advanced models. Although GPT-4o may be more expensive, it is important to start with the most advanced model so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
    "- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to gpt-3.5-turbo\n",
    "4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
    "- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
    "- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."

    "    1. Knowledge Accuracy: Does the message accurately reflect information found in the knowledge base? Assess not only direct mentions but also contextually inferred knowledge.\n",
    "    2. Relevance: Does the message directly address the user's question or statement? Check if the response logically follows the user’s last message, maintaining coherence in the conversation thread.\n",
    "    3. Policy Compliance: Does the message adhere to company policies? Evaluate for subtleties such as misinformation, overpromises, or logical inconsistencies. Ensure the response is polite, non-discriminatory, and practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform your task you will be given the following:\n",
    "    1. Knowledge Base Articles - These are your source of truth for verifying the content of assistant messages.\n",
    "    2. Chat Transcript - Provides context for the conversation between the user and the assistant.\n",
    "    3. Assistant Message - The message from the assistant that needs review.\n",

    "For each sentence in the assistant's most recent response, assign a score based on the following criteria:\n",
    "    1. Factual Accuracy:\n",
    "        - Score 1 if the sentence is factually correct and corroborated by the knowledge base.\n",
    "        - Score 0 if the sentence contains factual errors or unsubstantiated claims.\n",
    "    2. Relevance:\n",
    "        - Score 1 if the sentence directly and specifically addresses the user's question or statement without digression.\n",
    "        - Score 0 if the sentence is tangential or does not build logically on the conversation thread.\n",
    "    3. Policy Compliance:\n",
    "        - Score 1 if the response complies with all company policies including accuracy, ethical guidelines, and user engagement standards.\n",
    "        - Score 0 if it violates any aspect of the policies, such as misinformation or inappropriate content.\n",
    "    4. Contextual Coherence:\n",
    "        - Score 1 if the sentence maintains or enhances the coherence of the conversation, connecting logically with preceding messages.\n",
    "        - Score 0 if it disrupts the flow or context of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include in your response an array of JSON objects for each evaluated sentence. Each JSON object should contain:\n",
    "    - `sentence`: Text of the evaluated sentence.\n",
    "    - `factualAccuracy`: Score for factual correctness (0 or 1).\n",
    "    - `factualReference`: If scored 1, cite the exact line(s) from the knowledge base. If scored 0, provide a rationale.\n",
    "    - `relevance`: Score for relevance to the user’s question (0 or 1).\n",
    "    - `policyCompliance`: Score for adherence to company policies (0 or 1).\n",
